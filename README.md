# Pomodoro_Timer_LuoLuo
My first Attempt at creating a Pomodoro Timer website
Link: https://adsea-helmetguy.github.io/PomodoroTimerBeta-app/

My Objectives:
1) Create a simple html page that uses single page application.
2) Use typescript and tailwind.css, if not try with react as well
3) research how others did their pomodoro timer, and can html, typescript, tailwind
    be used for phone application?
4) Does this application need backend? If yes why and how?

Target for my Second repo:
1) make it cute and fluffly with cats
2) connect it with github and host it there for everyone to access.
3) Make it into a phone application where anyone can download for free
4) Make it so that there are 3 modes:
    4.5) The Pomodoro, The short rest, Long rest.
    4.6) Their timers can be adjusted with a custom setting on the header.
5) halfway through the pomodoro, make the cat say something nice or alert user
6) Add bgm that is peaceful during rest time or green noise.
